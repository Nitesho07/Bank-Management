# üè¶ Bank Management System  

## üìò About The Project

This project is a straightforward, terminal-based Bank Management System developed entirely in Python. It was built to apply and demonstrate a solid understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and Python fundamentals.

The system utilizes a simple **JSON file for data persistence**, showcasing practical skills in file I/O and data management within an application. The main goal was to build a functional and clear command-line application that simulates core banking operations, effectively demonstrating proficiency with concepts like **classes, objects, and methods** in a practical scenario.
