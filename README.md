# üè¶ Bank Management System  

## üìò About The Project  
This project is a straightforward, terminal-based Bank Management System developed entirely in Python.  
It's designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and basic data persistence through the use of a simple JSON file as a database.  
This approach avoids the complexity of a full-scale database, making the code more accessible for learning.  

The main goal is to provide a clear and functional example of a core banking application.  
It serves as an excellent educational tool for understanding classes, objects, and methods in a practical, real-world scenario‚Äîperfect for learning and demonstration purposes within our coding society.
